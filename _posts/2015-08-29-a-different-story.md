    Had the fish with a slight interest in collecting birthday cakes from ocularists around the world not stroked the cat whose cousin invented the concept of chemistry in a third-rated fashion show, oh, it would have been *a different story*. The author is not aware of that, of course, and so are the readers who cease to exist the moment they learn about every aspect of *the story*. Despite that, *the story* continues even though no one is reading it. That is how good *the story* is.

Had the fish with a slight interest in collecting birthday cakes from ocularists around the world not stroked the cat whose cousin invented the concept of chemistry in a third-rated fashion show, oh, it would have been *a different story*. The author is not aware of that, of course, and so are the readers who cease to exist the moment they learn about every aspect of *the story*. Despite that, *the story* continues even though no one is reading it. That is how good *the story* is. One shall never underestimate a story and what it may bring forth. There was one time when a cat who was featured in a documentary on the history of socialism belittled *the story* and announced to himself with a very negative tone - negative enough to upset his nonexistent neighbours and friends - that *the story* was too surreal to be told in the great funeral of a prosthetic eye once belonged to the queen, he ended up becoming an antagonist in *a different story*. His mother was so proud of him she actually bought a pet from the public swimming pool, ignoring the fact that it was where the first anecdotal evidence of *a different story* was discovered by a group of performance artists to testify the definition of art and the laws of nature. There was something cathartic about it. 

Years have passed since then. The cat is now imprisoned in a glass jar the size of the observable universe for some absurd reasons having to do with a forggoten dream of the queen, a certain unethical traffic light powered by solar energy and a rhapsody composed by his attorney who fantasies about starting up a high frequency trading firm in the middle of the ocean. Every day he would try to escape, but that requires understanding the essence of love and seeing the world as it isn't, which is precisely what his father is not capable of.
