    This afternoon while I was eating my cereal I turned on the LCD and let [Ex Machina](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=Ex+Machina), the greatest motion picture ever produced by members of Homo Sapiens revolving around the theme of artificial intelligence and human psychology, played in the background as I sit lazily on the sofa and enjoyed my breakfast, and the indulgence in re-watching the flim eventually evolved into an act of procrastination. Then this hit me: the plot felt like it was progressing so much faster than it previously was the first time I watched the movie. In the blink of an eye the movie was alread in stage X, that was how it felt like. Further introspection suggested that this phenomenon is not limited to just movies, but that there is clearly a discrepancy between our awareness about the flow of time when we re-watched a video for the second time, and that of when we watched it for the first time.

>For the best cinematic experience, I advice you not to watch the trailer because just like all movie trailers, it contains pieces of the plot-indicators that can overall serve as a spoiler to partially ruin the great peice of art.

This afternoon while I was eating my cereal I turned on the LCD and let [*Ex Machina*](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=Ex+Machina), the greatest motion picture ever produced by members of Homo Sapiens revolving around the themes of artificial intelligence and human psychology, played in the background as I sat lazily on the sofa and enjoyed my breakfast. The indulgence in re-watching the flim eventually evolved into an act of procrastination. Then this hit me: the plot cetainly felt like it was progressing faster than it previously was the first time I watched the movie. 

In the blink of an eye the movie was alread in stage X, that was how it felt like. 

Further introspection suggested that this phenomenon is not limited to just movies, but that there is clearly a discrepancy between our awareness about the flow of time when we re-watched a video for the second time, and that of when we watched it for the first time.

Is it a consequence of how consistent the neral networks are responding to the ever-changing visual stimuli in according to our intuitive expectation of how they would respond since we have already experienced beforehand what we are experiecing? 

Or perhaps is it because we are prompted to compute what is going to happen next as a response to the ever-changing visual stimuli, and the efficency of the computation, with the accuracy of the result, give us a feeling, which, when comparsed to how we previously felt when we first experienced it, made us feel like things are going so much faster and smoother this time? 

It is undeniable that our memories affect the way we experience time. More studies need to be done to understand how this phenomenon occurs, which would certinaly help us to gain a deeper insight into the way in which the brain preceives time.
