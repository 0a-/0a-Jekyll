    [*Ex Machina*](https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=Ex+Machina), the greatest motion picture ever produced revolving around the themes of artificial intelligence and human psychology, and one of the very few movies that I actually enjoyed, was just a few buttons away, in the the [Plex](https://plex.tv/) collection of a friend whom I currently stayed with.

    This afternoon while I was eating my cereal I turned on the LCD and let the movie played in the background as I sat lazily on the sofa and enjoyed my breakfast. It then suddenly hit me that the plot certainly felt as if it was progressing faster than it previously was the first time I watched the movie. 

    In the blink of an eye the story was already in stage X, that was how it felt like.

    Further introspection suggested that this phenomenon is not limited to just movies, but that there is clearly a discrepancy between our awareness about the flow of time when we re-watched a video for the second time, and that of when we watched it for the first time.

Further introspection suggested that this phenomenon is not limited to just movies, but that there is clearly a discrepancy between our awareness about the flow of time when we re-watched a video for the second time, and that of when we watched it for the first time.

Is it a consequence of how consistent the neural networks are responding to the ever-changing visual stimuli in according to our intuitive expectation of how they would respond since we have already experienced beforehand what we are experiencing? 

Or perhaps is it because we are prompted to compute what is going to happen next as a response to the ever-changing visual stimuli, and the efficiency of the computation, with the accuracy of the result, give us a feeling, which, compared to what we previously felt the first time when we watched the video, made us feel like things are going so much faster and smoother this time? 

It is undeniable that our memories affect the way we experience time. More studies need to be done to understand how this phenomenon occurs, as the way in which the brain perceives time remains an open question.
