>I've never imagined that writing <a href="http://0a.io/0a-explains-calculus">an article on calculus</a> and making some animated gifs can have such a huge impact in my life. 
>
>I left school at the age of 16 to pursue what I wanted to do in life. I had ambitious dreams. But throughout the years I learnt to be conscious of my naivety and ignorance. I understand that it is perfectly normal if it turns out that all this time I have been living in a delusional state. So far every project I started had failed. Things have not once gone as planned. 
>
>And they never will.

>Now and then I wondered if everything I'd done was just trick I played to make me feel better about myself, that I was nothing more than a pathetic idealist, kidding himself along on a senseless odyssey. So I was greatly surprised when I learnt that 30 thousand people had visited my website in a day because of an article I wrote. The link to the article had got good number of upvotes on both <a target="_blank" href="/0a-explains-calculus">Reddit</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8523150">HackerNews</a>. Some commented and told me it was good. Certainly this was nothing comparing to, say, proving P != NP, but I think I had never been this happy in my life before. The joy I felt - that could not be described in words.
>
>Once again, thank you all for the support. You had brightened my days up. And with a positive mind, gradually, I made the decision to be less of a shut-in and start going for meet-ups and conferences. I got to know many cool people and made some new friends.
>
>At the moment I'm busy with a couple of projects. I'm still reading up on general topology and working on the article, <i>0a explains: general topology</i>. At some point in time I decided to have set theory, which initially was one of its segments, in a separate article instead. And just to make things more interesting, I figured I should dive in a bit deeper and give an axiomatic view for some on the concepts.

>So here it is.
