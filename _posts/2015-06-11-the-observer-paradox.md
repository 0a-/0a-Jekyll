    Imagine you are dead, in which case the biological machinery that you once relied so much on is no longer functioning. Due to the [conversation of energy and mass](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_of_energy), the atoms made up this biological system won't just miraculously vanish. Theses atoms would remain pretty much the same, unless [nuclear reaction](http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/sobel/Nucphys/react.html) or [annihilation](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/antimatter) occurs (though there'd be changes in the configuration of electrons in the process of decomposition). At this point in time, it would be silly to still consider these atoms "you".

    But what are actually "you"? How should "you" be defined?

    To people around you, you are a concept they conceived in their mind based on their interaction with the being labeled "you", and the information they have about this being. To them, you are a construct of their own ideology. This version of you sometimes reflects the rose colored lenses through which they perceive the world a lot more than how it would reflect anything about the being labeled "you".

    To you, you are what that constitutes the idea of self. Apparently you possess a body, but the body is not what you identity you with when you think about you. You may incline to think that you are what that controls the body, makes decision, etc, that is, the mind. But let's for a moment remember that the brain is responsible for the construction of thoughts and it governs how the mind processes, similar to [a Turing machine governing how the computation is performed, defined in the transition function in relation to the states and alphabet](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/complexity/f11/all.pdf). So a question arises:

    <div class="d_shortcuts rows">
    What determines you to be the mind A that's constructed by brain A, instead of the mind B constructed by brain B, where A ≠ B?
    </div>

    This is a rather difficult question. Or perhaps a meaningless one, since it can be interpreted as asking "why are you you?"

    <h3>I shall now present to you the Theory of <i>The Observer</i>.</h3>

    Let's start off by defining a mind to be some aspect in certain Turing Machine's computation with some aspect satisfying the criteria to be a mind. (I'm giving an arbitrary definition here as that is not important in this hypothetical discussion.)

### I shall now present to you the Theory of *The Observer*.

Let's start off by defining a mind to be some aspect in certain Turing Machine's computation with some aspect satisfying the criteria to be a mind. (I'm giving an arbitrary definition here as that is not important in this hypothetical discussion.)

For every mind, there exists an *observer* that does nothing besides *observing* the mind. *An observer* is not a being, it exists outside the context of the universe which the Turing Machine is a part of. *The observer* of a mind is incapable of doing anything to the mind, as all it does is a one-way *observing*: a one-direction transfer of data. As far as *an observer* is concerned, other *observers* don't exist, because in the context of *the observer*, the only thing that exists is the mind.

> Here I'm taking more of an information approach to [the concept of existence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology). In the context of system A, X does not exist as long as
>
> 1. the information in system A relies nothing on the information of X, or any information X contains
> 2. any changes in the information of and in X has no impact on any information in system A
>
> Under this definition, the answer to the old philosophical "*[if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_a_tree_falls_in_a_forest)*" would be that both the tree and the sound don't not exist in the context of system A if and only if the two points above are satisfied.

For the sake of argument, if the observer of mind A were to be switched over with another observer that is observing mind B, it would have no effect on the minds or, affect any event in the Turing machines' universe.

The Theory of *The Observer* can be stated as follow: *You* are *the observer*. *You* are experiencing person A's life because *you* are *observing* some aspect of the computation happening in person A's brain. If making decisions with free will is defined as selecting a choice in a set of possible choices based on some dataset, from the point of view of person A's brain, that is preciously what the computation does. However, from the point of view of *the observer*, there exists no freedom of choice since everything about the computation at time T is already determined by how the Turing machine was defined and what were inputted, which all happened before time T.

> Here is an example. Person X murdered Person Y at time T. Person X did it as a result of a set of factors F happened before time T. The same set of factors F will not cause Person Z to murder Person Y, but it caused Person X to murder Person Y. That may be explained by the environment Person X grew up in (e.g. abused when young), and may [also have to do with genetics](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617230154/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1617230154&linkCode=as2&tag=0aarhe-20&linkId=IS6WNF3JSNF7JN77). So one way of looking at this is that Person X shouldn't be blamed because if we connect the dots together, we'd realize that Person X did not really have had a "choice" to become the person she/he was.

But by definition, *observer* contributes nothing whatsoever to the computation of the brain. So every thought in the mind is a product of the brain. That is to say, when *you* think *you* are engaging in the activity of thinking, *you* are obviously not, for *you* are *the observer* and *the observer* does not think (or engage in any activity apart from *observing*). However, everything happening in the mind is being observed by *the observer*, and for that reason, it is as if *you*, *the observer*, are thinking. And since the Theory of *The Observer* is also a product of the mind, it would not capture the true nature of *the observer*, and *the observer* would not have anything to do with this theory, because after all, *the observer* should not have any effect on the mind which *the observer* is observing.

Thus you are, after all, the mind, observed by *you*, *the observer* which does not exist in the context of the universe wherein the computational machine is, similar to how you, the mind, will not exist, after the computational machine no longer functions, in the context of the same universe.
