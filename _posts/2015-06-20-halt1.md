    Initially I just wanted to write about propositional, first-order and second-order logics and make it a short article like [the one on Jekyll](http://0a.io/Jekyll-in-3min-for-your-GitHub-page/). But then I got greedy. I want to dive in deeper. And not only that but I want to write about [constructive logic](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0444702660/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0444702660&linkCode=as2&tag=0aarhe-20&linkId=3K2T52254J7SR4HC), and outline its difference from classical logic. There are so much more on logic that I want to write about.

    And that means there are a lot of undergrad & grad texts reading to do.

    \[Added on Jun 30\]: [Daily Logs of Arch's](/dailylogs) has been resumed! But I'm still working on the article.
